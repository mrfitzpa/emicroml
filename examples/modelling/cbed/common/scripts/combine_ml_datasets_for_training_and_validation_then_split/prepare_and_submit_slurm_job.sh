# The current script is expected to be called only by the parent script with the
# basename ``execute_all_action_steps.py``, located in the same directory as the
# current script. The parent script performs the "action" of combining a given
# set of input machine learning (ML) datasets, then splitting the resulting ML
# dataset into two output ML datasets: one intended for training ML models for a
# specified task, the other for validating such ML models.
#
# The current script prepares and submits a SLURM job which:
#
#   1. Sets the remaining parameters required to execute the "main" steps of the
#   action that were not set by the parent script.
#
#   2. Prepares the input data required to execute the main steps.
#
#   3. Executes the main steps.
#
#   4. Moves non-temporary output data that is generated from the main steps to
#   their expected final destinations.
#
#   5. Deletes/removes any remaining temporary files or directories.
#
# The main steps are executed by running the script with the basename
# ``execute_main_action_steps.py``, located in the same directory as the current
# script.
