Examples of CBED-related tasks
==============================

..
   Below are links to some code examples of CBED-related tasks. The
   :ref:`examples_modelling_cbed_simulations_sec` page contains examples of
   generating simulated CBED patterns using the multislice method. These simulated
   CBED patterns are used elsewhere in other examples, including examples of
   machine learning tasks.
